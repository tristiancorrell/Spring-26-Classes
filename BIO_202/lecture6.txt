know RNA primary structure from lecture 4

information stored in RNA can be used to make copies via complementary base pairing

capable of catalyzing (speeding up) reactions: ribozymes
-information processing
-replication of hereditary information
-evolution by random changes in nucleic acids

phospholipids = glycerol linked to:
-hydrophilic "head"
-hydrophobic "tail"
molecules w both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions are called amphipathic
primary role of phospholipids is to form cell membranes

when amphipathic lipids aer placed in water
-the hydrophilic heads interact w water
-the hydrophobic tails interact w each other, away from water

they spontaneously form:
lipid bilayers
-phospholipid bilayer

the plasma membrane, or cell membrane, separates life from non-life
it is a selectively permeable membrane that separates the cell's interior from the external environment

small or nonpolar molecules move across quickly
charged or large polar substances cross slowly, if at all

factors that affect membrane permeability
1. number of double bonds in phospholipids' fatty acid tails (degree of saturation)
-more saturated tails -> less permeable
2. length of phospholipids fatty acid tails
-longer tails -> less permeable
3. temperature
-decreasing temperature -> less permeable 

diffusion is the spontaneous movement of solutes (small molecules and ions) in a solution
differences in solute concentrations create a concentration gradient
-there is a net movement from high concentration to low concentration

diffusion down a concentration gradient is spontaneous (occurs naturally and is energetically favorable)
equilibrium occurs when molecules or ions are evenly and randomly distributed
-molecules still move randomly
-but there is no more net movement in one direction

1. separation of solutes -> concentration gradient
2. diffusion
3. equilibrium

water moves quickly across lipid bilayers
-this is a special case of diffusion called osmosis
water moves from LOW SOLUTE concentration to HIGH SOLUTE concentration
-this dilutes the higher concentration on each side of the membrane
only occurs when solute cannot cross membrane

plasma membranes contain as much protein as phospholipids
proteins can insert into a membrane
-they can be amphipathic, since their side chains can be charged, polar, or nonpolar

proteins that span the membrane are integral membrane proteins
-they have segments facing both its interior and exterior surfaces

portions of these proteins that pass through hydrophobic tails of phospholipid bilayer have hydrophobic side chains

a key function of membrane proteins is transport
-channel proteins {passive transport
-carrier proteins }facilitated diffusion
-pumps -> active transport

when substances move down (or with) their concentration gradient w help from membrane proteins, this is passive transport
-does NOT require energy
-called facilitated diffusion
    -channel proteins
    -carrier proteins

when substances move up (or against) their gradient, the process is active transport
-REQUIRES energy, usually from ATP
-uses specialized protein pumps

channel proteins are selective
-amino acids facing inside the pore are hydrophilic
each channel protein permits only one particular type of ion or small molecule to pass through it

ion channels are specialized membrane proteins
-form pores in a membrane for ions to diffuse through
