know RNA primary structure from lecture 4

information stored in RNA can be used to make copies via complementary base pairing

capable of catalyzing (speeding up) reactions: ribozymes
-information processing
-replication of hereditary information
-evolution by random changes in nucleic acids

phospholipids = glycerol linked to:
-hydrophilic "head"
-hydrophobic "tail"
molecules w both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions are called amphipathic
primary role of phospholipids is to form cell membranes

when amphipathic lipids aer placed in water
-the hydrophilic heads interact w water
-the hydrophobic tails interact w each other, away from water

they spontaneously form:
lipid bilayers
-phospholipid bilayer

the plasma membrane, or cell membrane, separates life from non-life
it is a selectively permeable membrane that separates the cell's interior from the external environment

small or nonpolar molecules move across quickly
charged or large polar substances cross slowly, if at all

factors that affect membrane permeability
1. number of double bonds in phospholipids' fatty acid tails (degree of saturation)
-more saturated tails -> less permeable
2. length of phospholipids fatty acid tails
-longer tails -> less permeable
3. temperature
-decreasing temperature -> less permeable
