energy = capacity to do "work" (change or move something)
    -potential energy is enery that is stored
        -gravitational energy (gravity)
        -electrochemical gradients (ions)
        -chemical energy (bonds)
    -kinetic energy is energy of motion
        -thermal energy (heat)
        -mechanical energy (motion)
        -electromagnetic energy (light)

gibbs free energy (G) = free energy of a system = energy available to do work
    -a measure of spontaneity for the system
        ->will a reaction happen without energy input?
    -biochemistry focuses on changes in Gibbs free energy = delta G

two ways for delta G to change; two types of reactions

exergonic reactions: a reaction with a (-) delta G
    -energetically favorable, spontaneous
    -no energy input required, but might not be fast enough (hence enzymes)

endergonic reactions: a reaction with a (+) delta G
    -energetically unfavorable,  not spontaneous
    -must be coupled to another reaction with a greater delta G
        -provides energy input
temperature and concentration affect reaction rates
-higher concentrations and higher temperature increase reactane (substrate) collisions -> increase reaction rate

energetic coupling 
-between exergonic and endergonic reactions
-allows chemical enery released from one reaction to drive another reaction

reduction-oxidation reactions (redox reactions) transfer electrons
-oxidation: loss of an electron(s) and energy
    -LEO = losses electrons -> oxidation
-reduction: gain of an electron(s) and energy
    -GER = gains electrons -> reduction 

during a redox reaction, electrons can
-be transferred completely from one atom to another
-simply shift their position in covalent bonds

electrons are often accompanied by a proton (H+)
-reduction often adds H's
-oxidation often removes H's

electron acceptors gain potential enery as they are reduced
nicotinamde adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) accepts two electrons + one proton to form NADH
-NAD+ is reduced to NADH
