protein structure and function

-cells produce tens of thousands of distinct proteins
-amino acids are the building blocks of proteins
    -amino acids were most likely abundant during chemical evolution

20 amino acids (charged, polar, nonpolar)

amino acids are bonded to:
-H a hydrogen atom
-NH2 an amino functional group
-COOH a carboxyl function group
-R group -a variable "side chain"

in water, the amino and carboxyl groups ionize to NH3+ and COO-. respectively
    -amino group acts as a base and attracts a proton
    -carboxyl group acts as an acid and donates a proton
the resulting charges
    -help amino acids stay in solution
    -make amino acids more reactive

acid -> donates proton
base -> accepts proton
