Introduction
chemical evolution is the leading explanation for the origin of life on Earth. (short answer)
-> switch from chemical to biological evolution

-> Life had begun

2.1 The structure of atoms, ions and molecules
2.2 the unique properties of water
2.3 how do chemical reactions occur?
2.4 current models 
2.5 carbon

Atoms, Ions, and Molecules: The Building Blocks of Chemical Evolution
-hydrogen (H), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O)

Basic Atomic Structure
atoms are composed of 
protons- positively charged particles (+1 charge)
neutrons- neutral particles (no charge)
electrons- negatively charged particles (-1 charge)

protons and neutrons are located in the nucleus
the number of protons defines each atom

electons move around in orbitals surrounding the nucleus
each orbital can hold up to 2 electrons (one pair)
orbitals are grouped into levels called electron shells

electron shells are numbered 1,2,3 and so on
-lower numbered shells are closer to the nucleus
-the outermost electron shell of an atom is called its valence shell
-for this course, atoms are most stable when their valence shells are either full or occupied by 8 electrons
-> octet rule

valence of an atom= the number of unpaired valence electrons
elements highlighted in blue are most abundant in organisms

with your neighbor, work together to determine the valence of each column

top number - mass number (number of protons + neutrons)
bottom number - atomic number (number of protons)
table will be on quiz and exam

in an atom of an element: number of protons = number of electrons
in an ion of an element: number of protons -= number of electrons
- more protons than electrons = positive ion or cation
- less protons than electrons = negative ion or anion

how many protons, neutrons, and electrons are 
                                                protons         neutrons        electrons
in an atom of Cl?                              17               18              17
in a CL- ion?                                  17               18              18                         
in a MG2+ ion?                                 12               12              10

how many electrons are in the valence shells of Cl- and Mg2+? 8 in both

atoms are most stable when their valence shells are full
shells can be filled by formation of chemical bonds
-> attractions that bind atoms together

covalent vonds form when unpaired valence electrons are shared by two atoms

molecules are substances held together by covalent bonds

electrons are not always shared equally
atoms may have different electronegativities - the strength with which they pull electrons toward themselves

in general, moving up and to the right on the periodic table = higher electronegativity
- O > N > S ~= C ~= H ~= P

differences in electronegativity dictate how electrons are distributed in covalent bonds
non-polar covalent bond
-electrons are evenly shared between two atoms
-the bond is symmetrical
-example: C-H bond
polar covalent bond
-electrons are shared unevenly
-example O-H bond

polar bonds produce partial charges on atoms
(a) nonpolar covalent bond
(b) polar covalent bond

-holds electrons more tightly-has a partial negative charge
-the other atom will have a partial positive charge

-cation - an atom that loses an electron and becomes postiively charged
-anion - an atom that gains an electron and becomes negatively charged

ionic bonds result when electrons are transferred from one atom to another to give both atoms full valence shells
ionic bonds are the attraction between oppositely charged ions

-water is unique due to its structure
    -small size
    -bent shape (asymmetric)
    -highly polar covalent bonds
    -overall polarity

chemical evolution likely occurred in a water-based (aqueous) environment

water is polar
water molecules interact with each other
-partical negative charges on oxygen in one water molecule attract partial positive charges on hydrogen in another water molecule
-these weak electrical attractions are called hydrogen bonds

hydrogen bonds can also form between water and any other polar molecule or ion
-these are called hydrophilic ("water loving") substances

-> hydrogen bonding makes it possible for almost any polar molecule or ion to dissolve in water

hydrophobic "water-fearing" molecules
hydrophobic interactions: interactions between hydrophobic molecules that result from their exclusion from water
    - due to inability of hydrophobic molecules to form hydrogen bonds with water
    - these interactions are temporary

not really on exam or quiz*
    water has remarkable properties, largely due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds
        -cohesion
        -adhestion

cohesion is attraction between the same molecules
    -water is attracted to itself by hydrogen bonding

adhesion is attraction between different molecules
    -water is attracted to polar/hydrophilic parts of plastic or glass

will need to know the 6 major functional groups

organic compounds are molecules that contain carbon bonded to other elements
the formation of carbon-carbon bonds was an important event in chemical evolution

functional groups found in organic compounds
-amino group
-carboxyl group
-carbonyl group
-hydroxyl group
-phosphate group
-sulfyldryl group

describe a model for the chemicala evolution of life (know model name, and be able to describe what happens in the model)
(prebiotic soup model) (surface metabolism model)
