Cell Structure and Function Part II

prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells
similarities:
both have DNA
both have ribosomes

differences:
Eukaryotes have nucleus; prokaryotes do not
Eukaryotes have organelles; prokaryotes do not

plant and animal cells
similarities:
both have a nucleus
both have mitochondria

differences:
plants have chloroplasts; animals do not
animals have lysosomes; plants do not

match the organelles!

nucleus _2                                 1. processes, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for transport
ribosomes _3                               2. houses chromosomes that store and transmit genetic information 
smooth ER _4                               3. synthesizes proteins
rough ER _6                                4. synthesizes lipids
golgi _1                                   5. breaks down macromolecules
mitochondria _8                            6. synthesizes proteins that will be packaged and sorted by the endomembrane system
chloroplasts _7                            7. photosynthesis! plants only!
lysosomes _5                               8. generates chemical energy (ATP)!

proteins are made from ribosomes either:
-in the cytoplasm (free)
-bound to ER
proteins are trafficked (sent) to specific places in the cell through the endomembrane system
some proteins are secreted (released) from the cell by the endomembrane system to function elsewhere

the secretory pathway is the series of organelles in the endomembrane system through which a protein passes
-from where it was made to where it leaves the cell
these organells are particularly developed in cells specialized for protein secretion

discovering the secretory pathway: the pulse chase experiment
-start w/ a culture of cells
-"pulse" (add) a radioactively labeled amino acid for a set time
    -all proteins made during this "pulse" are radioactively labeled
after "pulse" period, wash away radioactively labeled amino acids and replace with unlabeled (normal) amino acids
proteins made during this "chase" period will not be labeled
    -but labeled proteins made during initial "pulse" will still be visible wherever they move to in the cell

-right after pulse (time 0), newly synthesized (and labeled) proteins are in the rough ER
-37 min into the chase, all labeled proteins are in the golgi
    -indicates that they have moved there
-117 mins into the chase, most of the labeled proteins have left the golgi and are in secretory vesicles

most proteins found inside the organelles are imported from the cytoplasm
proteins contain special signal sequences to target them to the appropriate organelles
-a signal sequence is like zip codes for mail
another example, proteins functioning inside the nucleus typically contain a 17-amino acid nuclear localization signal (NLS)
-targets them for transport into the nucleus via nuclear pore complexes

macromolecules must be digested by lysosomes before their subunits/monomers can be used by the cell
materials are brought into the cell by pinching off the plasma membrane in a process called endocytosis
    1. receptor-mediated endocytosis
    2. phagocytosis
lysosomes also digest large structures and organelles in the cytoplasm
-process called autophagy ("same/self-eating")
-portions of the cytoplasm, including damaged organelles, are enclosed to form an autophagosome
-fuses with a lysosome for digestion

the eukaryotic cytoskeleton:
    -is a dense and complex network of proteins that:
        -maintain cell shape
        -provide structural support
    -provides a "highway" system within cells
    -is highly dynamic

actin filaments are moved by myosin motor proteins
-when myosin "head" attaches to actin and moves, the actin filament slides

motor proteins move vesicles along micotubules
micotubules are railways for vesicles to be transported along by motor proteins

vesicle transport requires kinesin motor protein powered by ATP
    -the head region binds to a microtubule
    -the tail region binds to a vesicle
